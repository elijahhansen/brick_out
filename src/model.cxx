#include "model.hxx"

// Constructs a model from the given `Game_config`. Note
// that the `Game_config` is passed by `const&` but `Model`
// saves its own copy of it.
//
// The `config`, `paddle`, and `ball` member variables need
// to be initialized in an initialization list, not in the body
// of the constructor. And:
//
//   - The paddle needs to be initialized with its top-left
//     at `config.paddle_top_left_0()` and with dimensions
//     `config.paddle_dims`. The *static factory function*
//     `Block::from_top_left(Position, Dimensions)` can be used
//     to construct the `Block` you want.
//
//   - The ball needs to be initialized with the state of the paddle
//     and the game configuration.
//
// Then in the body of the constructor, we need to push_back
// `config.brick_rows * config.brick_cols` into the `bricks`
// vector. In details:
//
//   - Each brick should have dimensions `config.brick_dims()`
//
//   - The first (top-left-most) brick should have its top left
//     at the position {config.side_margin, config.top_margin}.
//
//   - You will need nested loops to create all the bricks in each
//     row and column, but note that the order doesn't matter.
//
//   - The offset between each brick and the next is given by the
//     dimensions of each brick plus `config.brick_spacing`.
//     Or in other words, the x offset is `config.brick_spacing.width
//     + config.brick_dims().width`, and the y offset is the same
//     but with heights.

// Warning! Until you write code inside these member functions
// that uses at least one member variable, CLion is likely to
// insist that you can make this function static. Don’t believe
// it! You’ll regret the change if you do once you want to
// access member variables, since a static member function
// doesn't have access to an instance. (You should delete this
// warning after you’ve read it.)
//
// TL;DR: Don't go adding `static` to members.

// If the ball isn't live then you need to make it track the paddle,
// which is best done by constructing a new `Ball` and assigning it to
// `ball`.

// speculatively as soon as you know that the ball is live, and again at the
// end, storing the result back to the ball that time.
